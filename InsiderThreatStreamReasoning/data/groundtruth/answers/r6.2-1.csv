The importance and antiquity of anekantavada are also demonstrated by the fact that it formed the subject matter of Astinasti Pravada, the fourth part of the lost Purva that contained teachings of the {IAST|Tirtha?karas} prior to Mahavira. This ecumenical and irenical attitude, engendered by anekantavada, allowed modern Jain monks such as Vijayadharmasuri to declare: I am neither a Jain nor a Buddhist, a Vaisnava nor a Saivite, a Hindu nor a Muslim, but a traveler on the path of peace shown by the supreme soul, the God who is free from passion. In recent times, Jainism influenced Gandhi, who advocated {IAST|ahi?sa} and satyagraha.

The origins of anekantavada can be traced back to the teachings of Mahavira (599-527 BCE), the 24th Jain {IAST|Tirthankara}. Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they do understand, they deny the aspects they don't understand. Nayavada is a compound of two Sanskrit words-naya (partial viewpoint) and vada (school of thought or debate). This means recognizing all aspects of reality, not merely one or some aspects, as is done in non-Jain philosophies.
